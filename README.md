# DHI dfsu Pipeline
This repository contains all the methods and packages necessary to construct a data Pipeline designed to move the raw
output of a DHI hydrodynamic model (.dfsu mesh files) to a web api that serves an interactive web dashboard that visualizes
the data.

## Requirements
TODO: Add Requirements for installation, conda envs, MIKE SDK, python libraries

## Pipeline Design
All the python packages and methods in the source code are used to implement a data pipeline that facilitates interactive web dashboards on top of the existing CDL data output that is generated by the DHI HD Model. A diagram of the pipeline that will be implemented is as shown:
